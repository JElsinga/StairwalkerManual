To visually display the aggregated dataset a third party application is used. This application is called GeoServer, GeoServer is an open source server which can be used to display geospatial data. In order to run GeoServer a web server is needed. 

During development the Apache Tomcat\footnote{\url{http://tomcat.apache.org/}} was used for this purpose. The use of Tomcat is not required for Stairwalker, alternative options may also be used as long as it is possible to deploy WAR files. Tomcat was used during development therefore a description of how to obtain Tomcat is given here. Furthermore whenever web hosting is mentioned in this manual it will be assumed Tomcat is being used.

Information about setting up a Tomcat server can be found on the \href{http://tomcat.apache.org/}{Apache Tomcat website}.
