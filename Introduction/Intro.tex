This manual will explain how to use the Stairwalker Program of the Database faculty of the University of Twente. This manual will start by explaining on how to install all required components in order to have the basic running. This includes how to install all the required extensions for your database but also for other applications that are required to run this system. The second section will explain how to add all databases and different kind of datatypes to Geoserver, which is required to show in order to make the Stairwalker program run. Not only is this section going to explain how to show the data but it will give the option to customize this view and have it display data on all possibly ways. And the third section will explain how to make adjustments to the existing program and what future possibilities the system has. For example on how to add a new dimension to the aggregation tool or how to use a different aggregation type (median for example). The last section covers further development on the Stairwalker program in case something that hasn't been made yet needs to be added. This manual is made for a Postgres database other database programs are also possible, however this manual will not cover how to install certain extensions on those programs.
