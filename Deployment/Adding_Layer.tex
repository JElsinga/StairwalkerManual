Now we have a source and have a style to use, it is time to setup a layer to display this style. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go to Configuration $\rightarrow$ Layers and press the button on top, A dropdown menu should appear in where the database has to be selected.  Once a database has been selected there should be a couple of options of which data should be displayed.
	\item Select the data you want and press Publish. Fill in all these fields in order to get the layer to work. Important are the projections. In our layers we use Projection of Source, EPSG:4326, and Given Projection, EPSG:3587. And set handling of the projection to use the given projection. Then for Boundary Rectangles let them be calculated based on sourceprojection. And then all fields should be filled in, do not press save yet however. 
	\item On top select publish. Select the style which should display your data, select the style that has been made in the last step here. If there is no style that can be displayed, something went wrong and the last steps should be repeated.
	\item Once this is done press save and the layer should be added.
\end{enumerate}
