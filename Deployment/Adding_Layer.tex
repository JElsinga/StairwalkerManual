Now we have a source and have a style to use, it is time to setup a layer to display this style. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go to Configuration -> Layers and press the button on top, you should get a dropdown menu in which you need to select your database. Once you've done this it should show the data which can be displayed. 
	\item Select the data you want and press Publish. You'll need to fill in all these fields in order to get the layer to work. Important are the projections. In our layers we use Projection of Source, EPSG:4326, and Given Projection, EPSG:3587. We set handling of the projection to use the given projection. Then for Boundary Rectangles let them be calculated based on sourceprojection. And then all fields should be filled in, do not press save yet however. 
	\item On top select publish. Here you can select the style you want to be used in order to display your data, select your own style here. \item Once this is done you can press save and your layer should be added.
\end{enumerate}
