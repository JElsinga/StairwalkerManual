Now in order to see the layer go to view, here it should display the layer that has been made (with the added name) with a dropdown menu. Select PNG/JPEG or something similar to show a basecase of the data. A new window should open and here it should show your data in a weird graph. If this is not the case, its likely a mistake in the style. It is also possible to adjust your view in the images by adding a VIEWPARAM to the url. To do so just add: \&VIEWPARAMS=$<$Type$>$:$<$Value$>$ to the url and the image should change.
