Now in order to see your layer go to view, here you should see your own layer with a dropdown menu. Select PNG/JPEG or something similar to show a basecase of your data. A new window should open and here you should be able to see your data. If this is not the case, its likely a mistake in the style. You can also adjust your view in the images by adding a VIEWPARAM to the url. To do so just add: \&VIEWPARAMS=$<$Type$>$:$<$Value$>$ to the url and your image should change.
