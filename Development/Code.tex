In this section some pointers will be given to important sections of code in terms of processing pre-aggregate indexes which are used by the GeoServer extension.

\subsubsection{Filtering Words for Nominal Axis}
\label{sec:filtering}
\todo[inline, size=\small]{This subsection should deal with filtering the GET request sent to GeoServer making the \&VIEWPARAMS work as desired. Also maybe other things with time or other axis??}


\subsubsection{Creating Pre-Aggregate Index from Source}
\todo[inline, size=\small]{This subsection should deal with creating a pre aggregate index using source code, this means defining ones own axis, pre-processing in terms of nominal axis and pointing to the right tables/column etc.}
